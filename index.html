            What is Water Wastage and How Does It Occur?
        </h2>
        <section class="advantages">
            <p class="p1">

                When talking about water waste, this can reference a few key areas. The water waste from a community of
                people is more commonly known as sewage. Household (or other buildings) wastewater can include the waste
                from toilets or from actions such as draining kitchen sinks. <br>
            
                Simply using too much water can very easily be done by anyone. Running a very long shower, loading your
                washing machine too regularly or leaving the tap running when brushing your teeth are all examples of
                how easy it is to waste this valuable resource. <br>

                In regard to sewage and wastewater from your pipes, damaging chemicals or cleaning products may be
                drained through your pipes, you may be using your sewage system too often, or it's always possible that
                large water treatment companies are not managing wastewater services in the best way to protect the
                environment. <br>

                What is the Impact of Wastewater on the Environment? <br>

                When considering the damage wastewater is capable of, the biggest threats to the environment are
                contamination and pollution. If sewage is not treated appropriately before being disposed of it, it can
                contaminate water and thereby put wildlife at great risk. <br>

                Furthermore, wastewater dispersed through flooding or leaks means that completely untreated water can
                enter water sources and pollute them. <br>
 
                The process of treating wastewater also requires fossil fuels. This means that wastewater treatment has
                the potential to increase carbon footprint and air quality. <br>

                Global Water Wastage Statistics 

                When considering the situation of water wastage and the earth's future, it's important to take into
                account daily water use and habits within other countries around the world. With these statistics, you
                can better understand how your own country (and therefore your own effort) is faring in comparison to
                other countries. <br>

                These statistics can show a shocking difference between water use statistics based on different
                countries. his is an important reminder of how all countries across the world need to work cohesively to
                lower water wastage and help save the environment. We're all living on the same planet, after all. <br>

                Belgium is the biggest daily consumer of water on average by individuals, with 7.406 liters. Kenya is
                the smallest daily consumer, with 50 liters. <br>

                You might expect that the country to house the biggest water consumption on a daily basis would be the
                country to have the largest population: but China, which does have the world's largest population, has a
                smaller daily water consumption than Belgium. <br>

                It just goes to show how each individual's water usage can make a significant difference.

                Countries such as Kenya are often struggling with a water crisis, which throws into sharp relief how
                valuable a commodity like water is. For countries on this list using a high amount of daily water,
                countries like Kenya, in comparison, are using very little simply because they do not have access to
                safe water. <br>

                It's now more important than ever to preserve the water that the world does have.

                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration:underline ;">Sources of Wastewater </span><br>

                The common sources of wastewater are domestic sewage wastewater and non-domestic wastewater. Here’s a
                brief lowdown
                <br>
                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;">
                    Domestic Sewage</span><br>

                The wastewater created from homes, public toilets, hotels, resorts, motels, schools, religious
                institutions, hospitals, doctors’ clinics,
                sports centers, and apartments can be classified as domestic sewage wastewater. The mentioned
                institutions individually and collectively create
                significantly high levels of wastewater
                <br>
                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;"> Non-Domestic Water
                </span><br>

                This includes the wastewater created from floods, rainwater runoff, swimming pool water, garage water,
                and water from cleaning centers.
                Wastewater generated from salons, commercial kitchens, energy units, and agricultural facilities can
                also be classified into this category.

                So, in a way, the water used in both residential and commercial units will add to the volume of
                wastewater produced by the property.<br>

                    Effects of Wastewater</span><br>

                As you’d probably guess at this stage, the impact of wastewater is devastating, to say the least. It
                adversely impacts the environment
                and ends up ruining the ecological balance.
                Its impact on human health is equally alarming. Here’s a shortlist of the worst effects of wastewater.
                <br>

                <span style="color:rgb(20, 165, 165); text-decoration: underline;">Contamination of Habitat and Water
                </span><br>

                The first and the most pronounced impact of wastewater is the fact that it ends up contaminating and
                (eventually) destroying the natural habitats. Over time, the wildlife residing in these habitats are
                affected as they are under the exposure of harmful chemicals
                borne by the water. So, wastewater doesn’t just destroy habitats, but it also ends up killing the
                animals living there.

                Wastewater can be treated in wastewater treatment plants which include physical, chemical and biological
                treatment processes. Water that is no longer needed or is no longer suitable for use in bilge water that
                can be discharged back into the environment and it is formed by a number of activities including
                bathing, washing, using the toilet and rainwater runoff. Wastewater treatment is a process used to
                convert wastewater into an effluent outflowing of water to a receiving body of water that can be
                returned to the water cycle with minimal impact on the environment or directly reused. The principal
                objective of wastewater treatment is generally to allow human and industrial effluents to be disposed of
                without danger to human health or unacceptable damage to the natural environment. Wastewater treatment,
                also called sewage treatment, the removal of impurities from wastewater,
                or sewage, before they reach aquifers or natural bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, estuaries, and
                oceans
